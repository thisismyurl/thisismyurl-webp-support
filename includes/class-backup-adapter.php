 * Vault soft-adapter.

 * One job: take an extra safety snapshot through whichever backup engine is
 * installed, before any destructive file operation (convert / optimize /
 * restore). It prefers Vault, falls back to the older Shadow Guardian engine,
 * and gracefully does nothing when neither is present.
 *
 * This adapter is intentionally a no-op safety net layered ON TOP of each
 * plugin's own per-file backup. The plugin keeps its own backups/restore path
 * regardless — Vault is extra insurance, never the only copy.
 *
 * This is the canonical copy shared verbatim across the image / webp / heic /
 * svg / bmp plugin family. Keep it engine-agnostic: the only plugin-specific
 * input is the context slug and the label passed by the caller.
 *
 * @package TIMU_WEBP_Support
