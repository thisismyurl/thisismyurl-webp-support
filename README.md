**WebP Support by thisismyurl.com** is a lightweight, professional-grade tool designed to make your WordPress site faster, leaner, and more responsive. 

WebP images are the industry standard for modern web performance, offering significantly smaller file sizes than JPEG or PNG while maintaining crisp visual quality. This plugin ensures your WordPress workflow is fully optimized for these files, giving you better SEO rankings and a faster experience for your mobile users.
